            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step4">
                <h2>Step 4: Swiss-PdbViewer Interface Overview</h2>
                <p>After dismissing the splash screen, you'll see the main interface of Swiss-PdbViewer. Let's familiarize ourselves with the key components:</p>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/image13.jpg" alt="Swiss-PdbViewer Toolbar" class="tutorial-image">
                <p>The interface consists of several important areas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Menu Bar:</strong> At the very top, you'll find menus like File, Edit, Select, Build, etc. These contain various commands and options for working with your molecular structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toolbar:</strong> Below the menu bar, there's a toolbar with icons for quick access to common functions. The toolbar is divided into several sections:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>File operations and general controls (left side):</strong> These include options to open files, save your work, and perform general operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Measurement and analysis tools (center):</strong> Tools for measuring distances, angles, and performing various analyses on your molecules.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manipulation tools (right side):</strong> These include options to rotate, translate, and zoom your view of the molecule.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Main Viewing Window:</strong> The largest part of the interface where your molecular structures will be displayed in 3D.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Panel:</strong> Usually located to the side or as a separate window, this panel allows you to manipulate individual residues or groups of residues in your structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Status Bar:</strong> At the bottom of the window, providing information about the current state of the program or selected elements.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Take a moment to look around the interface and familiarize yourself with these components. In the following steps, we'll dive deeper into using these tools to visualize and analyze molecular structures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step5">
                <h2>Step 5: Open Your Custom Structure</h2>
                <p>Now that we're familiar with the interface, let's open a molecular structure. In this tutorial, we'll assume you have a structure file that you've designed using ProBuilder or obtained from AlphaFold. If you don't have such a file, you can download a sample PDB file from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) for practice.</p>
                <p>To open your structure:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ensure you have a structure file (.pdb format) saved on your computer. PDB (Protein Data Bank) format is a standard file format for representing 3D structures of proteins and nucleic acids.</li>
                    <li>In Swiss-PdbViewer, click on "File" in the top menu.</li>
                    <li>Select "Open" from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O (Windows) or Cmd+O (Mac).</li>
                    <li>In the file browser that appears, navigate to the location where you saved your structure file.</li>
                    <li>Select the file and click "Open". You may see a loading progress bar as the program reads the file.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After a moment, your structure should appear in the main viewing window. Here are a few things to note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the structure doesn't automatically center in the view, don't worry – we'll cover how to adjust the view in the next step.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the size and complexity of your structure, it may take a few seconds to load, especially on older computers.</li>
                    <li>By default, the structure is usually displayed in a line or wireframe representation. We'll learn how to change this in later steps.</li>
                    <li>If you open multiple PDB files, they will be loaded into separate layers, which can be managed through the Control Panel.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you encounter an error when opening your file, ensure it's a valid PDB format. Some common issues include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>File is corrupted or incomplete</li>
                        <li>File is in a different molecular file format (e.g., .mol2, .xyz)</li>
                        <li>File contains unsupported elements or non-standard residues</li>
                    </ul>
                    If problems persist, try opening a known good PDB file from the Protein Data Bank to verify that SwissPDB Viewer is functioning correctly.

                <h2>Step 6: Basic Manipulation Tools</h2>
                <p>Now that your structure is loaded, let's explore the basic tools for manipulating your view of the molecule. These tools are essential for examining different parts of your structure and understanding its 3D arrangement.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Movement</th>
                        <th>Mouse Control</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Toolbar Button</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Rotate</td>
                        <td>Left mouse button</td>
                        <td>Click and drag to rotate the structure. Moving up/down rotates around the x-axis, while moving left/right rotates around the y-axis. This allows you to view the molecule from different angles.</td>
                        <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/image14.jpg" alt="Rotate button" class="button-image"></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Translate</td>
                        <td>Right mouse button</td>
                        <td>Click and drag to move the structure within the viewing window. This is useful for centering specific parts of your molecule or moving it to a better viewing position.</td>
                        <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/image15.jpg" alt="Translate button" class="button-image"></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Zoom</td>
                        <td>Both mouse buttons</td>
                        <td>Click and drag both mouse buttons simultaneously. Moving up zooms out, moving down zooms in. This allows you to examine details or view the overall structure. Alternatively, you can use the scroll wheel on your mouse.</td>
                        <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/image16.jpg" alt="Zoom button" class="button-image"></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p><strong>Practice exercise:</strong> Try these movements with your loaded structure:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rotate the molecule 360 degrees around the vertical axis.</li>
                    <li>Zoom in to examine a specific region, then zoom out to see the whole structure.</li>
                    <li>Use the translate function to move the molecule to different areas of the viewing window.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Remember, you can always reset your view if you get lost – we'll cover that in the next step.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step7">
                <h2>Step 7: Centre View</h2>
                <p>After manipulating your view, you might want to reset it to a standard position. The "Centre View" function is perfect for this:</p>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/image21.jpg" alt="Centre View button" class="button-image">
                <p>This button, typically the leftmost on the toolbar, performs several actions simultaneously:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It adjusts the translation of your molecule so that it's centered in the viewing window.</li>
                    <li>It adjusts the zoom level so that the entire molecule is visible.</li>
                    <li>It resets the center of rotation to the middle of the visible structure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Try using the Centre View button now. Notice how it repositions your molecule for optimal viewing.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use this function whenever you feel "lost" in your structure or when you want to start examining it from a standard view.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step8">
                <h2>Step 8: The Control Panel</h2>
                <p>The Control Panel is a powerful tool for manipulating your structure at a more detailed level. It allows you to control the display of individual residues or groups of residues.</p>
                <p>If you can't see the Control Panel:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the "Window" menu in the top toolbar.</li>
                    <li>Select "Control Panel" from the dropdown list.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/control-panel.jpg" alt="Control Panel" class="tutorial-image">
                <p>The Control Panel provides detailed information about your structure and allows you to change various display options. Here's what each column in the Control Panel means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group:</strong> This column describes each residue in your structure. The format is typically [Chain][Secondary Structure][Amino Acid][Position]. For example, "A s GLY95" means Chain A, part of a β-sheet (s), Glycine at position 95.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show:</strong> Toggles visibility of backbone atoms for each residue. A checkmark means the backbone is visible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Side:</strong> Toggles visibility of side chains for each residue. A checkmark means the side chain is visible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Labl:</strong> Adds a floating label next to the residue in the 3D view. Useful for identifying specific residues.</li>
                    <li><strong>::</strong> Shows whether each residue has an associated surface. This is used when displaying molecular surfaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ribn:</strong> Toggles ribbon representation for each residue. Useful for visualizing secondary structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Col:</strong> Indicates the color applied to each residue. You can change colors here.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can click on these columns to toggle options on or off for individual residues or entire sections of your structure.</p>
                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Try toggling different options in the Control Panel and observe how it affects the display of your molecule in the main viewing window.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step9">
                <h2>Step 9: Making Selections with the Control Panel</h2>
                <p>The Control Panel is not just for viewing information; it's also a powerful tool for selecting specific parts of your structure. This is crucial for many operations, such as changing colors or representations of specific regions.</p>
                <p>Here's how you can make selections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select a single residue:</strong> Simply click on the residue name in the "Group" column.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select all residues in a chain:</strong> Click on the chain identifier at the start of the chain in the "Group" column.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select all residues in a secondary structure element:</strong> Click on the secondary structure identifier (H for helix, S for sheet, etc.) in the "Group" column.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select multiple residues:</strong> Click and drag over multiple rows in the Control Panel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add to a selection:</strong> Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking to add to your current selection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select a range:</strong> Click the first residue, then hold Shift and click the last residue to select all residues in between.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simmsj3/swisspdbviewertutorial/main/images/control-panel-selection.jpg" alt="Control Panel Selection" class="tutorial-image">
                <p>Selected residues are highlighted in red in the Control Panel. In the 3D view, selected residues are typically highlighted or displayed differently, depending on your current visualization settings.</p>
                <p><strong>Practice exercise:</strong> Try the following selections:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select all residues in an alpha helix.</li>
                    <li>Select a range of 10 consecutive residues.</li>
                    <li>Select all glycine residues in your structure.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use the "Select" menu in the top toolbar for more advanced selection options, such as selecting by residue type or solvent accessibility.</p>

                        <figcaption>Spacefilling representation: Atoms are shown as spheres with their full van der Waals radii. Useful for visualizing surface properties and interactions. This representation gives a good sense of the molecule's volume and shape.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Ribbon representation: Simplifies the structure to show secondary structure elements. Helices are shown as coiled ribbons, beta sheets as arrows, and loops as thin tubes. This is excellent for visualizing the overall fold and secondary structure composition of proteins.</figcaption>

                <p>To change the representation of your molecule:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the part of the molecule you want to change using the Control Panel (as learned in Step 9).</li>
                    <li>Go to the "Display" menu in the top toolbar.</li>
                    <li>Choose the desired representation from the options available.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Practice exercise:</strong> Try displaying different parts of your molecule in different representations. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Show the backbone in ribbon representation</li>
                    <li>Display a specific residue in ball and stick representation</li>
                    <li>Use spacefilling representation for surface residues</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Combining different representations can be very powerful for highlighting specific features of your molecule while maintaining context of the overall structure.</p>
